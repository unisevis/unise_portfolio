# Project 1: Is virtual reality game a valid and reliable tool to measure children's navigation skills?
This is my thesis project that examines whether the Congolese children's navigation skills can be more conveniently assessed with a virtual reality game. Working with research teams in the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands, my task is to find the answer by digging into the data avaiable. 

Technology used: R (dplyr, ggplot, ggeffect, lmer, glmmTMB, car, sjplot), Excel (pivot), powerBI (dashboard)

Step 1 define
- Researched factors affecting navigation skills.
- Developed analysis plan.

Step 2 data preprocessing
- Cleaned data to maintain good data quality.
- Aggregated variables from master .csv file in Excel (pivot table) and R (dplyr).

Step 3 exploratory data analysis
- Visualized raw data with an overview dashboard with PowerBI to obtain better understanding.

Step 4 data analysis (R)
- Checked model assumptions with plots.
- Built generalized linear mixed effects model.

Step 5 data visualization and communicating results
- Visualized model results using ggeffect package in R
- Created summary tables of important statistics
